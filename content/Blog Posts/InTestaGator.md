## Overview

Quizagator is an online tool that allows the creation of tests to be made
through text based syntax as opposed to using a GUI. This means that a
quiz can be created through the use of a text editor. This allows the
creation of tests to be much simpler as there is no need to alter
the quizzes in the GUI tools. This system is created using Flask and
Python along with the use of a SQLite3 database which manages the quizzes
and results. A link to the project can be found
