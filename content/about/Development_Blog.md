## Overview

GatorGrader is a tool designed to be used with GitHub, GitHub Classroom, Travis CI,
and Gradle, another tool in GatorEducator. It is designed for automatic assessment
of programmers and writers. You can find the GitHub documentation
[here.](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader)

## What I did

I worked on a team of five people in order to add a new feature that would
obtain issues from the GitHub issue tracker. I implemented code to link the
GatorGrader code to GitHub in order to retrieve issues. Then I worked with one of
my colleagues to implement the retrieval of issues based on user specifications.
